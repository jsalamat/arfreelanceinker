          <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

          <p>I'm a Freelance Graphic Inker.  I have been working in the industries for over a decade. You will notice that I included the pencils as well as my finished inks in my portfolio section to visually show how my inks enhance the quality of the pencilers works. When I work I try to enhance the pencilers work by using a variety of line thickness and variety of textures to illustrate the illusion of space, texture, and form.. I will be adding more of my inks  as the time progresses, so keep an eye out for new works. I hope you will enjoy my website and please feel free to contact me with questions, comments, and possible collaboration opportunities!. I HAVE ALSO DONE WORK AS AN INKER ON:
          <br>
          " INFERNO RESSURECTION" ISSUES 2 THRU 5 FOR ZENESCOPE COMICS. GHOSTED BACKGROUNDS FOR MARK TEXIERA ON DC'S JONAH HEX/ LOONEY TUNES AND DEATHSTROKE/YOGI BEAR ONE SHOT AND A MILLION WAYS TO DIE HARD AND HAVE WORK ON VARIOUS TITLES FOR INDEPENDENT COMPANIES. </p>
